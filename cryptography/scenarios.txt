===== Communication Scenarios =====

1 Since PITM is assumed to be impossible, then it is safe for Alice and Bob to use 
Diffie-Hellman to agree on a key K and then use AES with that K to send the message.
This is secure because Eve cannot detirmine K without the use of a PITM attack.

2 In this scenario, it is important to note that we don't care if the message is 
readable to Eve, just that it can't be modified. Because of this Alice can hash the
message H(M) and then encrypt the hash with her secret key E(S_A, H(M)) = C. She then 
sends the message in plain text to Bob with C appended to the end. Bob recieves M' (which
may or may not have been tampered with) calculates E(P_A, C) = E(P_A, E(S_A, H(M))) = H(M),
as well as H(M'). If these two operations have the same result, the message is intact.

3 This basically combines the two previous scenarios. Since we are still assuming that 
PITM is impossible, Alice and Bob can use DH to find a shared key K. Then Alice should hash 
the message H(M), encrypt the message ASM(K, M), and encrypt the hash with her private key
E(S_A, H(M)). She then sends ASM(K, M) || E(S_A, H(M)) to Bob. Eve could decrypt the hash, 
but that won't give her any information about the message. Bob can decrypt the message 
M' = ASM(K, C) and the hash E(P_A, E(S_A, H(M))) = H(M), and compute his own hash of the 
recieved message H(M'). If H(M) = H(M') then he knows both that the message is uncorruped,
and that the sender must have Alice's secret key. (So by our assumptions they must be Alice).

===== Breaking Security =====

4 Alice lost control of her secret key - This is reasonably likely, but doesn't reflect 
favorably on Alice, also Mal would also need to be a PITM for this to work.

Mal (or Bob) got lucky and broke either the hash or Alice's secret key encryption - This is 
highly unlikely, there is a lot of mathematical proofs behind this taking a really long time.

Alice's Public Key is incorrect. - This is reasonably likely, especially in this scenario without
a Public Key Infrastructure. But this should be relatively easy to verify by looking at other 
communications with Alice.

5 I am going to define "bob.com" || P_B as TBS. Then Cert_B is TBS || E(S_CA, H(TBS)). 
In words, the CA hashes the TBS and then encrypts the hash with its secret key to get Sig.

6 Bob and Alice would have to also create a DH key K. Then Alice can challenge Bob with a random
number R, to which Bob replies with E(S_B, H(K||R)). Alice can verify using Bob's public key 
and her own hash of K and R. If this checks out, she can be confident thatthe person on the 
other end has Bob's Secret Key.

7 If Mal can obtain Bob's Secret Key, then a PITM attack works. (Mal does the classic PITM attack
on the DH process, then uses S_B to pass Alice's Challenge). If Mal can somehow impersonate the CA,
either by getting its Secret Key or by creating a new corrupt (but trusted) CA. Mal can issue fake 
certificates that allow her to know "Bob's" Secret Key.
