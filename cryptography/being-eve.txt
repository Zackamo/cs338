===== Diffie-Hellman =====
Known Info:
g = 11, p = 59
Alice sent Bob: A = 57
Bob sent Alice: B = 44

Unknown:
X, Y (Alice and Bob's secret numbers)
K the shared secret

Work:
A = g^X mod P. To find X I brute forced guesses for X in the python interactive shell. I found X = 36.
Now that I have X, I can calculate S with B^X mod p = K:
K = 36.

I used a brute force method of trying all integers until I found one that worked.
This works fine for small numbers but would take a very long time for large integers.

===== RSA =====
Known Info:
Bob's public key: (13, 5561)

I used a short python program to brute force the factorization of p and q from n (5561).
I found p = 67 and q = 83.
The python program is called being-eve-rsa.py and can be found in this directory.
From this p and q I can find the lcd(p-1, q-1) = 2706 (online)
I can then check that gcd(13, 2706) is indeed 1. (https://calculationcalculator.com/gcf-of-13-and-2706)
So then I just need to find a d that works so I need 13*d mod 2706 = 1.
For this I again used my python program to brute force d = 1249.
Finally I used python to decrypt the message. looking at the plain text I decided
that it looking like ascii encoding so I also had python decode the message as ascii characters.
this turned out to be right and I got a sensical message. (Why did you have to slip in another Schneier link?)

The message was:
Hey Bob. It's even worse than we thought! Your pal, Alice. https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/04/airtags-are-used-for-stalking-far-more-than-previously-reported.html

There are two points where my process would have likely failed with larger integers. First I brute forced factoring
n in python, in N was very large this would take forever. Second I brute forced finding d.
While this is an easier process than finding n, it would have still taken quite awhile if the numbers were bigger.

Finally I noticed just by looking at the ciphertext that the number 570 appears a lot. Turns out this corresponds
to the space character (ascii 32). This occurs because the message is encrypted one char at a time, meaning its
just a substitution cipher, making it rather unsecure. (I was already guessing that 570 might be spaces).
