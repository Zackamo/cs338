=== 1 Passive Information Gathering ===

Domain: www.minecraft.net
IP address: 13.227.36.(38-59-34-57) <- nslookup gives all of these final numbers.
Expiration: 05-18-2023

The listed registrar is MarkMonitor LLC. This is a privacy proxy that (presumably Microsoft) is using. 
It looks like the web server used AWS. Searching the IP with whois turned up Amazon. 
Netcraft lists Akamai Technologies as the "Netblock Owner" not sure how that relates.

=== 2 Host Detection === 

Local Network:
192.168.231.2
192.168.231.128 - this is the same ip that i got with ifconfig
192.168.231.129 - discovered in part 3 that this is metasploitable

It sent a "Standard Query" packet and got a responce packet.

Carleton:
137.22.4.5 - elegit.mathcs.carleton.edu
137.22.4.17 - perlman.mathcs.carleton.edu
137.22.4.131 - maize.mathcs.carleton.edu

It sends tcp handshake SYN requests to each ip address. 
The ones with hosts send back a RST flag.

=== 3 Port Scanning ===

MNetasploitable's ports:
21  / ftp
22  / ssh
23  / telnet
25  / smtp
53  / domain
80  / http
111 / rpcbind
139 / netbios-ssn
445 / microsoft-ds
512 / exec
513 / login
514 / shell
1099/ rmiregistry
1524/ ingreslock
2049/ nfs
2121/ ccproxy-ftp
3306/ mysql
5432/ postgresql
5900/ vnc
6000/ x11
6667/ irc
8009/ ajp13
8180/ unknown

I see 2 database ports: 3306 (MySQL) and 5432 (PostgreSQL) and 1524 (ingreslock)
I see an SSH RSA hostkey: 2048 56:56:24:0f:21:1d:de:a7:2b:ae:61:b1:24:3d:e8:f3 
theoretically this should represent an RSA public key but I don't quite see it.
I looked up ingreslock because I had not heard of it before. turns out its an 
old database system that is inteded to allow locking of parts of a database. However, 
it is now mostly known for its vulnerability to backdoor connections.
