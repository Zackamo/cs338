Why does nslookup give non-authoritative answers? what does it mean for these answers to be authoritative? 
(What power or info do the other sources that it points to a authoritative have?)

Why does searching by ip seem to give different answers? (answers that seem to relate to a different server)
I still don't know what the xx.xx.xx.2 address is, is it something standard?
